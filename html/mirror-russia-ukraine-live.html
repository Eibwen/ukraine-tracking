Fear of democracy, of freedom, fear of the kind of popular uprisings witnessed over recent years in Ukraine ever happening in Russia.&quot; She said the &quot;anti-Putin forces within Russia&quot; must have &quot;encouragement and moral support&quot;, as she made clear this was a critical moment. &quot;Future generations will judge the actions the world takes in this moment,&quot; Ms Sturgeon said. &quot;There are, of course, many complexities but at its most fundamental this is a clash between oppression and autocracy on the one hand, and freedom and democracy on the other. &quot;We must all ensure that freedom and democracy prevail.&quot;","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Andy Lines in Kiev","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-lines/"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Abigail O'Leary","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/abigail-oleary/"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mirror","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png","width":219,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26323753.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Pro-Ukraine-Demonstration-In-London.jpg","width":615,"height":409},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Russian attack helicopters fly above Kyiv","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655#531251","datePublished":"2022-02-24T12:39:43.567+00:00","dateModified":"2022-02-24T12:39:43.567Z","articleBody":"Footage reportedly taken in Hostomel, close to Kyiv, shows at least eight attack helicopters flying close to the ground as smoke rising around them.

He has attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population A vast invasion is underway by land by sea and by air. And this is not in the infamous phrase some faraway country of which we know little We have Ukrainian friends in this country; neighbours, co-workers Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny We &#x2013; and the world &#x2013; cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away. It is because we have been so alarmed in recent months at the Russian intimidation that the UK became one of the first countries in Europe to send defensive weaponry to help the Ukrainians. Other allies have now done the same and we will do what more we can in the days ahead. Today in concert with our allies we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy. And to that end we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics. Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically &#x2013; and eventually, militarily &#x2013; this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure. And so I say to the people of Russia, whose president has just authorised a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people. The parents of Russian soldiers who will lose their lives. I cannot believe this is being done in your name or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime and I say to the Ukrainians in this moment of agony we are with you we are praying for you and your families and we are on your side And if the months ahead are grim, and the flame of freedom burns low I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine because for all his bombs and tanks and missiles. I don&#x2019;t believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free and I say to the British people and all who have heard the threats from Putin against those who stand with Ukraine we will of course do everything to keep our country safe. We are joined in our outrage by friends and allies around the world. We will work with them &#x2013; for however long it takes &#x2013; to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored because this act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine. It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world. This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future and that is a right that the UK will always defend.","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Andy Lines in Kiev","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-lines/"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Abigail O'Leary","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/abigail-oleary/"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mirror","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png","width":219,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26323753.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Pro-Ukraine-Demonstration-In-London.jpg","width":615,"height":409},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"PM: Putin has made Putin a pariah state","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655#531242","datePublished":"2022-02-24T12:07:42.559+00:00","dateModified":"2022-02-24T12:07:42.559Z","articleBody":"&quot;So I say to the people of Russia, whose president has just authorised a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people,&quot; the PM says. &quot;The parents of Russian soldiers who will lose their lives.

In an address on Russian state TV, broadcast at the same time as the U.N. Security Council began its meeting in New York, Putin announced his military operation in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters after the council meeting it was &quot;the saddest moment&quot; in his more than five years in the job, appealing: &quot;President Putin, in the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia.&quot; &quot;This conflict must stop now,&quot; he said. Russia&apos;s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia notified the council of Moscow&apos;s move during the meeting, justifying it under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which covers individual or collective self-defense by states against armed attack. Britain&apos;s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward described Russia&apos;s move on Ukraine as &quot;unprovoked and unjustified.&quot; French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said: &quot;This decision - announced at the very moment when the council was meeting - shows the disdain that Russia has for international law and for the United Nations.&quot; Thomas-Greenfield said she would put forward a U.N. Security Council on Thursday, which de Riviere said would condemn &quot;the war conducted by Russia.&quot; The move is doomed to fail as it will can be vetoed by Russia, but it gives Washington and allies a chance to try and isolate Moscow over its actions. Diplomats said the council would likely vote before the end of the week. &quot;We believe that the door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, nor should it be,&quot; China&apos;s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told the Security Council as the violence escalated in Ukraine. Ukraine&apos;s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Russia had just declared a war on his country and told Nebenzia at the end of the council meeting: &quot;There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.&quot; Nebenzia responded: &quot;We aren&apos;t being aggressive against the Ukrainian people, but against the junta that is in power in Kyiv.&quot;","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Andy Lines in Kiev","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-lines/"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Abigail O'Leary","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/abigail-oleary/"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mirror","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png","width":219,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26323753.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Pro-Ukraine-Demonstration-In-London.jpg","width":615,"height":409},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Britain will respond 'decisively', says Johnson","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655#531106","datePublished":"2022-02-24T05:30:19.975+00:00","dateModified":"2022-02-24T05:47:25.459Z","articleBody":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russian President Vladimir Putin has &quot;chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction&quot; with his attack on Ukraine and that the UK and its allies would respond &quot;decisively&quot;.

Ukraine&apos;s army is also better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine without a fight, and is widely seen as highly motivated to defend the country&apos;s heartland. Here are some details of Ukraine&apos;s military. <b>How do the numbers look?</b> In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grim for Ukraine. Most military experts&apos; estimates put the number of Russian troops near Russia&apos;s border with Ukraine at more than 100,000. Russia has also moved some troops to Belarus, north of Ukraine, for military drills. Russia&apos;s army has about 280,000 personnel and its combined armed forces total about 900,000, while its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine&apos;s by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). Ukraine&apos;s prime minister said a decree recently signed by Zelenskiy - on priority measures to strengthen the state&apos;s defence capabilities, increase the attractiveness of military service and the gradual transition to a professional army - would eventually bring Ukraine&apos;s armed forces to 361,000 personnel. Although Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from 2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure in 2020 amounted to only $4.3 billion, or one-tenth of Russia&apos;s. Military analysts say Ukraine&apos;s anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences are weak, leaving it highly vulnerable to Russian strikes on its critical infrastructure. They say Russia would also seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary&apos;s command and control and cut off communications with units in the field. <b>How experienced are Ukrainian forces?</b> Ukraine&apos;s forces have gained combat experience in the Donbass region in the east of the country, where they have been fighting Russia-backed separatists since 2014, and are highly motivated. They also have short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry, including U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles, which would help to slow any Russian advance. Beyond the regular army, Ukraine has volunteer territorial defence units and around 900,000 reservists. Most adult males have at least basic military training, so Russia could find itself facing stubborn and protracted resistance if it tried to capture and hold onto territory.

Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters on a flight returning from a trip to Africa that the crisis between Ukraine and Russia had shown the necessity of the S-400s purchase, given the security risks in the region.

Turkey has called the move unjust and demanded reimbursement for its $1.4 billion payment. Erdogan has said that payment should be used to finance some of Turkey&apos;s request to buy 40 F-16s and nearly 80 modernisation kits.

Shelling is also often known as artillery fire, big guns launching huge projectiles at enemy positions from far away. So, when reports come from the Donetsk front lines claiming that shelling has taken place it means the people there have come under explosive artillery fire from the enemy. The tactic can be particularly brutal and indiscriminate because, with the shot fired often from a large distance and packed with high explosives, they can easily hit people and things they weren&#x2019;t intended for. Over the past few days, multiple news outlets have reported on the strife of people living near the conflict zone who have suffered from the renewed shelling.","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Andy Lines in Kiev","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-lines/"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Abigail O'Leary","sameAs":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/abigail-oleary/"}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mirror","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png","width":219,"height":60}},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article26323753.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_Pro-Ukraine-Demonstration-In-London.jpg","width":615,"height":409},"mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655"},{"@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"Convoy of 100 trucks heads to Ukraine border ","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-ukraine-war-live-putin-26295655#530870","datePublished":"2022-02-22T18:03:50.709+00:00","dateModified":"2022-02-22T18:03:50.709Z","articleBody":"A military convoy of more than 100 trucks with soldiers was seen heading in the direction of the Ukrainian border in Russia&apos;s Belgorod region, a witness said.
